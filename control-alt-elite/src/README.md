This is a game I worked on with three other people. Chris Rhodes, Nick Barnes, and Eric Viveiros.
I mainly contributed with the ship MVC. This was the first to get implemeneted and after that was done the Enemy MVC was 
able to be completed easily since it was similar. I also helped implement the button controls for the GUI in the main galaxydefender class.
They are poorly implemented due to time contraints but I'm pleased with what we were able to accomplish in a week.
